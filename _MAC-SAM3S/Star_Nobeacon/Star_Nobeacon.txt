MAC Example - Star_Nobeacon


Setup
=====
The firmware for the MAC example "Star_Nobeacon" can be created in three ways: Using the corresponding Makefile directly, executing the Makefile from the AVR Studio or building it from the IAR EWW.
Two nodes are involved in this example. Both nodes are operated using the same firmware.


Operation
=========
Switch on node one; LED 0 indicates that the node has started properly. Flashing of LED 1 indicates that the node is scanning its environment. Scanning is done three times on each available channel depending on the radio type. If no other network with the pre-defined channel and PAN Id is found, the node establishes a new network at the pre-defined channel (channel 20 for 2.4GHz radio). The successful start of a new network is indicated by switching LED 1 on.
Switch on the other node;LED 0 indicates that the node has started properly. Flashing of LED 1 indicates that the node is scanning its environment. Scanning is again done three times on each available channel depending on the radio type. If a proper network is discovered, the node joins the existing network and indicates a successful association by switching on LED 1. Every two seconds this nodes sends out a dummy data packet. If the packet is acknowledged by the other node the LED 2 is flashing.
